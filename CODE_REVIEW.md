## 1. Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1: Hardcoded Salt in Encryption Module

**File:** [`core/crypto.js:7`](core/crypto.js#L7)

**Issue:**
```javascript
const KEY = crypto.scryptSync(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'salt', 32);
```

The encryption module uses a hardcoded salt value `'salt'` instead of a unique, randomly generated salt. This significantly weakens the encryption security.

**Impact:**
- All encrypted data uses the same derived key
- Makes rainbow table attacks feasible
- Compromises the security of any encrypted sensitive data

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
// Store a unique salt per installation in the environment
const SALT = process.env.ENCRYPTION_SALT || crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
const KEY = crypto.scryptSync(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, SALT, 32);
```

**Action Items:**
1. Generate unique salt per installation
2. Store salt in environment variables or secure storage
3. Add salt validation on startup
4. Document migration path for existing encrypted data

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2: Missing Encryption Key Validation

**File:** [`core/crypto.js:7`](core/crypto.js#L7)

**Issue:**
```javascript
const KEY = crypto.scryptSync(process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY, 'salt', 32);
```

The module crashes if `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is undefined, and there's no validation for key strength or format.

**Impact:**
- Application crashes on startup if key is missing
- No validation that the key meets minimum security requirements
- Silent failures possible with weak keys

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
function validateEncryptionKey() {
  const key = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY;
  if (!key) {
    throw new Error('ENCRYPTION_KEY is required. Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32');
  }
  if (key.length < 32) {
    throw new Error('ENCRYPTION_KEY must be at least 32 characters');
  }
  return key;
}

const ENCRYPTION_KEY = validateEncryptionKey();
const KEY = crypto.scryptSync(ENCRYPTION_KEY, SALT, 32);
```

**Action Items:**
1. Add key validation on module load
2. Provide clear error messages with generation instructions
3. Add key strength requirements to documentation
4. Consider key rotation strategy

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-3: MongoDB Connection String Exposure

**File:** [`core/mongo.js:13`](core/mongo.js#L13)

**Issue:**
The MongoDB URI is logged in plain text if connection fails, potentially exposing credentials.

**Impact:**
- Credentials could be exposed in log files
- Centralized logging systems (Loki) could contain sensitive connection strings
- Compliance violations (PCI-DSS, GDPR)

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
// Sanitize MongoDB URI before logging
function sanitizeMongoUri(uri) {
  if (!uri) return '[not configured]';
  return uri.replace(/:\/\/([^:]+):([^@]+)@/, '://***:***@');
}

// In error handling:
logger.error(`Mongo connection error: ${err?.message}`, { 
  uri: sanitizeMongoUri(uri),
  stack: err?.stack 
});
```

**Action Items:**
1. Implement URI sanitization function
2. Audit all logging for credential exposure
3. Review Loki logs for historical exposure
4. Add log sanitization guidelines to documentation

---

## 2. High Priority Bugs

### 🟠 HIGH-1: Race Condition in Module Hot-Reload

**File:** [`index.js:382-399`](index.js#L382-L399)

**Issue:**
The debounced hot-reload mechanism can cause race conditions when multiple files change rapidly.

**Impact:**
- Module state corruption during rapid file changes
- Duplicate event listeners if unload fails
- Memory leaks from unreleased resources

**Recommendation:**
```javascript
// Add module state lock
const moduleLocks = new Map();

async function reloadModuleWithLock(moduleName) {
  if (moduleLocks.get(moduleName)) {
    log.info(`Reload already in progress for ${moduleName}, skipping`);
    return;
  }
  
  moduleLocks.set(moduleName, true);
  try {
    await unloadModule(moduleName);
    await loadModule(moduleName);
  } finally {
    moduleLocks.delete(moduleName);
  }
}
```

---

### 🟠 HIGH-2: Shutdown Race Condition

**File:** [`index.js:89-194`](index.js#L89-L194)

**Issue:**
The shutdown handler uses `Promise.allSettled()` but has a timeout that forces exit. This can leave resources in an inconsistent state.

**Impact:**
- Database connections may not close properly
- In-flight transactions could be interrupted
- Corrupted state in persistent storage

**Recommendation:**
Implement graceful degradation with phased shutdown and better error tracking.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-3: Missing Error Handling in Lifecycle Disposal

**File:** [`core/index.js:57-67`](core/index.js#L57-L67)

**Issue:**
The dispose function catches errors but doesn't track which disposables failed.

**Impact:**
- Hard to identify which resource cleanup failed
- No retry mechanism for failed disposals
- Resource leaks possible

**Recommendation:**
Track and log failed disposals with identifiable information.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-4: Unsafe MongoDB Query Construction

**Issue:**
MongoDB queries constructed from user input without proper validation could lead to NoSQL injection.

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized data access
- Query performance degradation
- Potential data exfiltration

**Recommendation:**
Implement query sanitization and use allowlists for field names.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-5: Missing Rate Limiting on User Interactions

**File:** [`core/interactions.js:100-226`](core/interactions.js#L100-L226)

**Issue:**
The interaction dispatcher has no rate limiting, allowing users to spam buttons/selects.

**Impact:**
- DoS attacks via rapid button clicking
- Database overload from rapid state changes
- Discord API rate limit violations

**Recommendation:**
Add per-user rate limiting with token bucket algorithm.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-6: Memory Leak in Event Listeners

**File:** [`core/commandHandler.js:72-73`](core/commandHandler.js#L72-L73)

**Issue:**
The `interactionCreate` listener is added but never removed, causing memory leaks during hot-reloads.

**Impact:**
- Memory usage grows with each hot-reload
- Multiple handlers execute for single interaction
- Eventually causes OOM errors

**Recommendation:**
Track and remove listeners properly during cleanup.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-7: Unhandled Promise Rejections in Interaction Handlers

**File:** [`core/interactions.js:218-225`](core/interactions.js#L218-L225)

**Issue:**
Error recovery can itself fail, and the inner catch swallows the error silently.

**Impact:**
- Users don't receive feedback on errors
- Errors are lost and can't be debugged
- Poor user experience

---

### 🟠 HIGH-8: Command Deployment Diff Logic Issue

**File:** [`core/commandHandler.js:364-371`](core/commandHandler.js#L364-L371)

**Issue:**
The `deepEqualRelevant` function can throw but is caught silently, leading to incorrect change detection.

**Impact:**
- Commands incorrectly marked as changed
- Unnecessary Discord API calls
- Rate limiting issues

---

### 🟠 HIGH-9: MongoDB Connection Pooling Issues

**File:** [`core/mongo.js:12-42`](core/mongo.js#L12-L42)

**Issue:**
No validation ensures minPool <= maxPool, and pool sizes lack validation.

**Impact:**
- Configuration errors cause silent failures
- Poor connection pool sizing affects performance
- Connection exhaustion under load

---

### 🟠 HIGH-10: Missing Interaction Token Expiry Handling

**File:** [`core/interactions.js`](core/interactions.js)

**Issue:**
No handling for expired interaction tokens (15-minute Discord limit).

**Impact:**
- Failed deferred responses after 15 minutes
- Poor user experience with silent failures
- Wasted API calls

---

### 🟠 HIGH-11: Insecure Status Cycler
